# AMATH-301-Classwork
 Classwork for AMATH 301 ("Beginning Scientific Computing") at UW during Autumn Quarter 2020. The class served as an introduction to MATLAB and to the field of scientific computing. Note that some instructional files have been omitted due to potential copyright issues; this repo contains the code I wrote during the course and not the assignment outlines themselves.
